# The Death Grip (Android App)

**The Death Grip** is a playful Android application that simulates the infamous antenna signal loss issue (often referred to as the "Death Grip") experienced by some smartphones when held in a specific way.

This project is a humorous take on the antenna gate issue from around 2010.

## Features

*   **Interactive Signal Simulation:** Touch and hold the "death area" (the bottom left corner of the phone frame) to watch the signal bars drop, simulating the signal loss issue.
*   **Bumper Mode:** Click the "Home" button to enable the "Bumper" case simulation. This changes the signal behavior, making it fluctuate rather than drop completely, offering a "fix" for the issue.
*   **Sound Effects:** Includes sound effects for signal changes and interactions.
*   **Retro Experience:** A nostalgic look back at early smartphone controversies.
